# Deeplex Learning Platform

An interactive neural network visualization and training platform built with React and TypeScript. This educational tool allows you to configure, train, and visualize neural networks in real-time.

## Features

- 🧠 **Interactive Neural Network Builder** - Add/remove layers and configure neurons
- ⚡ **Multiple Optimizers** - Support for SGD with momentum and Adam optimizer
- 📊 **Real-time Visualizations** - Watch network activations, weight distributions, and training progress
- 🎯 **Custom Training Data** - Add and modify training samples on the fly
- 📈 **Performance Metrics** - Track loss, epochs, and prediction accuracy
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** - Modern gradient design with Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
